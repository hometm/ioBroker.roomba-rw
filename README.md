# Roomba-rw (Roomba RooWifi) Adapter for ioBroker
===============================

## General note
Roomba-rw works only with "RooWifi" module- it will not work with Roomba integrated Wifi models. Due to physical issues and very limited usage of this adapter, there are no updates planned

## Description
ioBroker Adapter for monitoring/operation of Roomba cleaners over RooWifi. This adapter uses just the Roomba SCI 
interface. The RooWifi interface (http interface) can be used by an other application, vis or javascript.

Up to now, the following functionality is supported:  

* Direct commands for on-device-buttons    
      * Power  
      * Dock  
      * Clean  
      * Spot  
* Input SciCmd for Roomba SCI commands  
* Export of sensor data (refer SCI documentation), triggered by input ExportSensorData  
* Direct drive commands (enabled/disabled by 'true'/'false')  
      * Forward (FW)  
      * Backward (BW)  
      * Rotate clockwise (RCW)  
      * Rotate counter clockwise (RCCW)  
      * Stop driving (Stop)  
      * Set drive speed (DriveSpeed 0-500mm/sec)  
      * Set rotate speed (RotateSpeed 0-500mm/sec)  
      * Main brush (MainBrush)  
      * Side brush (SideBrush)  
      * Vacuum (Vacuum)  
* Feedback SciCmdTargetReached is set, if target distance/angel ist reached  
* Outputs for most common sensor data (temperature, voltage, current,...) are present. The update of these outputs 
 can be triggered by ExportSensorData.  
* In case of a dangerous situation Roomba is stopped:  
      * An obstacle is hit  
      * A virtual wall is reached  
      * A cliff is detected  
      * A wheel drop  
      * Motor overcurrent  


### SCI Commands
Input SciCmd is used for execution of any SCI command. The following topics has to be noted:  

* Just one command at a time  
* The single bytes of the SCI command are written as hex values: e.g. 137(dec) -> 0x87  
* Seperate the different bytes by a blank: e.g. 0x89 0x0 0x0 0x80 0x0 (this pattern equals STOP command)  
* A distance target can be set by Parameter 'D='. This parameter needs a value in millimeters 
e.g. 0x89 0x0 0x64 0x80 0x00 D=1500 (Roomba forward command. Stopps automatically if target distance 1500mm is reached)  
* A angle target can be set by Parameter 'A='. This parameter needs a value in degrees 
e.g. 0x89 0x0 0x32 0xff 0xff A=-90 (rotate Roomba clockwise. Stopps automatically if target angle -90deg is reached)  
* A delay of >20msec is required between different commands  
* No extra characters (commas, semicolon, quotes,..) are needed!  
* Roomba can be programmed for playing sounds :-)  

__Note on target distance/angle:__  
The status reading over SCI and required calculation is based on multiple sensors. Each sensor has its own toleracne. 
Due to many cyclically calculations, the mathematical reproduction of the past physical movement can lead to an 
arithmetical error. The faster the drive/rotation speed, the bigger the arithmetical error!  

### Configuration
The following configuration parameter are required inside ioBroker adapter configuration:  

* RooWifi IP address (e.g. 192.168.2.20)  
* RooWifi network port (default 9001)  
* State poll cycle in milliseconds (500 is a good value). In this cycle, the internal sensor vales are polled. A faster 
cycle leads to too much stess for the machine and a bigger arithmetical error (in case of target distance/angle calculation). 
A lower cycle leads to a blur of the sensor values and a resulting delayed stopp of target distance/angle.    
* Username/password for Roomba
